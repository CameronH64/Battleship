		Implement a class "AccountDatabase" that will store:
		
		username (String)
		password (String, encrypted)
		
		I must be able to instantiate this class in the BattleshipServer class.
		(If you can instantiate it in this very class, then I can instantiate in the BattleshipServer class).
		
		I need methods that will allow me to:
		
		Store this data into the database.
		Retrieve this data from the database.
		
		Hint: Lab 7 In should be a good baseline for this!
